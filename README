This is a tool to create immersive magic foliage for a GURPS type roleplaying system.
partial credit goes to my good friend Dan Herron for the GURPS knowledge and prototyping and all the python implementation was done by me.

...it is far from complete, at the time of creation it will have the ability to load a series of datasheets with plant biases and a series of methods for mainting successful functioning and also loading "plant data" from the given datasheets or a random one.

(still being developed)
- a function to compute rarity that is also implemented in get_random_plant that allows random plants to be selected from a set of occurrence values or from a truly random set.

- a function for generating unique names for plants based on computed properties
- a function for generating "quality modifiers" for the plant name.
- a function for generating a "description" field for plant instances based on properties
