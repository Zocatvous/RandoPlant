1. URL mappers to forward the supported URLs (and any information encoded in the URLs) to the appropriate view functions.

	the URLs that you need for your pages are:

	catalog/ - The home index page.
	calatog/books/ - a list of all books. (this can be.. a list of all characters or effects to be grabbed by the plants potentially?)
	catalog/authors/ - a list of all authors. (this is a list of all plants in the game!) 
	catalog/book/<id> - the detail view for a particular book, with a field primary key of <id> 
	catalog/author/<id> - detail view for a particular author, same as above


2. View functions to get the requested data from the models, create HTML pages that display the data, and return the pages to the user to view in the browser.
3. Templates to use when rendering data in the views.
