Hey Myduong,

thanks for the prompt reply! I am looking to initially get an idea of what kind of inspiriation and artistic direction you would get for a single plant. This game is all about highly detailed plants with lots of uses and functions. About their history and relation to a world of much deeper mysteries.

I have many different plants that i would love to have assets for but I think initially I would like to see just one plant in a few different phases of growth and potency as this will be one of the dimensions that will change which asset the game will select to display to the player.

The different plant sizes that are possible for a single plant are - in increasing size:

Puny
Tiny
Small
Medium
Large
Very Large
Jumbo
Humongus
Massive
Gigantic
Collosal
Cyclopean
Primodial


The assets should be small enough that they can be easily called by an API call without issues with latency - (they also dont need to be very complicated) differences in size can be indicated as subtly or as grandiosely as you see fit within the parameters I've given here.

Additionally there are a number of different "affinities" that a plant can have in addition to its size which can be indicated by color filters/overlays or anything else that makes minimal alterations to the underlying "size corresponding image" etc.

Steel - Metal
Wild - Animal Spells
Bloody - Body Control Spells
Pleasant - Communication Spells
Solid - Earth
Ethereal Enchantment
Flickering - Fire
Nutritious - Food
Comforting - Healing
Ephemeral - Illusion + Creation
Erudite - Knowledge
Radiant -  Light + Dark
Staid - Structural Spells
Fractal  -  Meta-spells
Alluring -  Mind Control
Shuddering  - Movement
Abyssal -  Necromantic
Virdant -  Plant Spells
Shrouded  - Protection
Quiet -  Sound
Flowing  - Water
Storming -  Weather
Delicious  - Flavor


Im very interested for starters to just see a single plant done with a handful of different 4 size categories for each plant and affinities to see what kind of design direction you would take with each particular asset, Also - please consider the criteria as guidelines and not rules. Im looking for someone that I can hopefully come back to for more follow up images if I like the direction you take visually.

The four sizes can be broken up into tiers:

Tier 1 - (puny, tiny, small, medium) - This will be one asset for a plant
Tier 2 - (Large, Very Large, Jumbo, Humongus) - 1 Asset per plant
Tier 3 - (Massive, Gigantic, Colossal, Cyclopean) - 1 Asset per plant
Tier 4 - Primodial - 1 Asset per plant (this one can be crazy)

I'll include some reference images in my next message so you have those as well with some commentary about how they relate to my objective.
All that is left now is to select a single plant from the list below to generate a sprite sheet for and I will send you a paragraph of lore relating to it.
